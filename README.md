# Retail Sales Data Analysis using MySQL

This project demonstrates analytical SQL skills applied to a hypothetical retail dataset. The focus is on writing structured queries to solve business-style data problems using JOINs, aggregation, grouping, and subqueries.

## Project Purpose
The goal of this repository is to showcase SQL query logic by creating and executing analytical queries that highlight trends and insights from structured data tables.

## Database Schema
Two example tables are defined:
- customers (customer_id, customer_name)
- orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, amount)

## Query Highlights
Included SQL queries demonstrate:
- Total spending per customer
- Customers with above-average spending
- Monthly revenue trends
- Table joins combining customer and order data

## What I Learned
Working on this project helped me improve my understanding of SQL query logic, especially JOINs, aggregation, and filtering data correctly. It strengthened my ability to approach data problems in a structured and analytical way.
